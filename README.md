A simple PDF resume builder written in React, utilizing the [React-Pdf](https://github.com/diegomura/react-pdf) library to construct the final document. The project currently features two templates, one single column and one two column, with more to be added in the future. Unlike many client side PDF builder results, Byte Resume's downloaded PDF retains hyperlinks and remains fully searchable.
